Ukraine control map, by Playfra

A map that shows the control of the ground adjacent to the Ukrainian settlement of Robotyne, recently subject to intense fighting for its control.


The map is mostly based on Twitter and Telegram sources, satellite imagery and already-existent maps, such as ProjectOwlOsint's map and DeepStateMap.

This map is also available on Playfra1.github.io

As of now, I am the only one working on this map. Despite this, updates should be coming in every day, barring unforseen events.
