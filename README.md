Ukraine control map - by @Playfra

A map that shows the control of the ground adjacent to the Ukrainian settlement of Robotyne, recently subject to intense fighting for its control.


The map is mostly based on OSINT, geolocations, Twitter and Telegram sources, as well as Sentinel-2 & EarthCache satellite imagery.

The map is also available on Playfra1.github.io (Work in progress) and in https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/0/viewer?hl=it&mid=1oEtMBEGWIrZIIgIqOWcr7g99dujWshQ&ll=47.45273450438414%2C35.847975276692594&z=13

As of now, I am the only one working on this map, so it covers a small area, but it is because of this that this map is usually more accurate compared to other maps also covering this region. Despite the very small numbers involved in the project, updates should be coming in every day, barring unforseen events.
